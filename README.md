# Lunar-Bead-NanoSIMS

This repo contains code used to analyse and visualise data collected using NanoSIMS

The files needed to intitially process data colleted by the NanoSIMS are in the folder initial processing.

The files in Import-and-Cycle-Plotting are used to present the data in a readable format, and save it into excel. They also create plots of element counts on the y-axis against cycle number on the x-axis.
