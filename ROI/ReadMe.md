# ROI

The user draws a polygon surrounding the Region of Interest (ROI) on the nanosims image. Pixels inside and outside of this image are then found.

Do this using ROIfreehand.m. ROI_draw is deprecated.

FirstFirstCreator takes the first frame from the NanoSIMS movies, and uses this as the image on which to draw ROIs.
